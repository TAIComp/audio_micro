Please provide the final version of the codes please: See i had my program in test.go file and it was working fine. however now i wanted to devide it into several parts could you please help me provide the final version of the correct code please.


Please keep in mind that mian.go is main architecture which runs all other files.

So basically the program that i want should act like this:

The goal is to have Tutor AI speech to speech conversation. There will be speech to text file which will always do the speech to text and send it either for updating interim/final for getting input of user during full_listening state or uses speech to text for detecting interruption commands/keyboard during interrupt_only state. For this I have 2 states: full_listening state and interruption_only state. 
Program starts with full_listening state and during this part the text from speech to text goes to the updating interim/final and finals will be sent to gpt for understanding if the sentence is completed: true/false and index for playing contexbased audio. When the gpt answer for sentence being completed is true and waiting time passes 1second or sentence being completed is false and waiting time passes 2 second the program should make isComplete true and send the last final for generating answer to gpt. Please keep in mind that isComplete should be true only if the waiting timing is fully passed for example i mean if user is speaking said Hello how are you and gpt said that sentence is completed and waiting timf of 1 second started and went till 0.5 and user said doing the program should updated final to hello how are you doing? and check for complitence of the sentence form gpt if it is true start waiting time from 0 out of 1 and only when the waiting time is finished which means that 1 second passed only the the isComplete is true and final be send to gpt. the same goes to when the gpt is incomplete the waiting time of 2 second should be fully finished only after when the waiting time is finished then the isComplete should get true and the final text be send to gpt for getting answer. After isComplete being true the program should change state from full_listening to interrupt_only. Which means that during state being interrupt_only the text from speech to text will be used only for detecting interrupt commands. 

After isComplete being true and the final sending to gpt for generating in order to reduce waiting time of user for gpt streaming answer text and doing steaming audio, before this the program should play the contextbased/randomd auido and simultanously do the streaming text of gpt and stroring the streaming audio in the buffer. when the contextbased audio finished it shoud run streaming audio of the stream and finish it. 
Context audio being played and simultanously the streaming text and audio being done.

After streaming audio is done or the interruption being detected either interruption command or interruption with keyboard the program should restart and work as cycle. I mean restart variables and change state from interrupt_only to full_listening. 








I have devided test.go into several parts now i want to get the same result as i got in my test.go. from files of main.go and folder of modules with other go files


I want to get similar to this result:

Capital refers to resources that can be used to generate wealth or support business activities. 

In economics, capital can be money, physical assets like buildings and machinery, or even intellectual property. It's crucial for starting or expanding a business.

For example, if you want to open a bakery, the money you invest to buy ovens and ingredients is your capital.
